# 2dArray_life
This is an application i'm making, incorporating various different aspects which I want to improve my knowledge on.
It's not really a fully fledged app, but more of a mish mash of little things I want to look at.
So far, things contained within are:
-enums
-classes
-2d arrays
-interaction with neighbouring cells in 2d arrays
-object orientated programming (in progress!)

The aim of this is to raise my skills up a level and allow me to make more complex applications. Creation of Conways Game of Life
is a perfect example of something, I feel encompasses a lot of the things I want to improve upon.
